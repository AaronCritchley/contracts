PyContracts is a Python package that allows to declare constraints on function parameters
and return values. It supports a basic type system, variables binding, 
arithmetic constraints, and has several specialized contracts (notably for Numpy arrays). 
Pycontracts can parse the contracts specified in RST docstrings (using the standard ``:type:`` and ``:rtype`` constructs); that way, your code is automatically documented.
